              <p class="overview_para">Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus. The term Covid 19 is sort of an acronym, derived from “Novel Corona Virus Disease 2019”. Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness. The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes and how it spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face. The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes, so it’s important that you also practice respiratory etiquette (for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow).</p>

        <div class="trans_p1">
            <p>Droplets or aerosols:When an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks, droplets or tiny particles called aerosols carry the virus into the air from their nose or mouth. Anyone who is within 6 feet of that person can breathe it into their lungs.</p>
            <p>ㅤㅤㅤㅤ</p>
            <p>Airborne transmission:Research shows that the virus can live in the air for up to 3 hours. Experts are divided on how often the virus spreads through the airborne route and how much it contributes to the pandemic.</p>

        <div class="trans_p2">
            <p>A less common method is when you touch surfaces that someone who has the virus has coughed or sneezed on. You may touch a countertop or doorknob that's contaminated and then touch your nose, mouth, or eyes. The virus can live on surfaces like plastic and stainless steel for 2 to 3 days. </p>
