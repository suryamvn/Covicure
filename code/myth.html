                <p>Hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine, a common treatment for malaria and certain autoimmune diseases, has been studied as a preventative treatment for COVID-19.

            <div class="misdisinfo_img"><img src="img/misdis info.gif" width="500px"></div>
            <div class="misdisinfo_para">
                <p>Information is what we call things that are accurate to the best of our current knowledge. For instance, COVID-19 stands for coronavirus disease 2019 and is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. One of the difficulties with any new pathogen, like this coronavirus, is that information changes over time as we learn more about the science.</p>
                <p>ㅤ</p>
                <p>Misinformation, on the other hand, is false information. Importantly, it is false information that was not created with the intention of hurting others. Misinformation is often started by someone who genuinely wants to understand a topic and cares about keeping other people safe and well. It is then shared by others who feel the same. Everyone believes they are sharing good information – but unfortunately, they are not. And depending on what is being shared, the misinformation can turn out to be quite harmful.</p>
                <p>ㅤ</p>
                <p>At the other end of the spectrum is disinformation. Unlike misinformation, this is false information created with the intention of profiting from it or causing harm. That harm could be to a person, a group of people, an organization or even a country. Disinformation generally serves some agenda and can be dangerous. During this pandemic, we are seeing it used to try to erode our trust in each other and in our government and public institutions.</p>

            <div class="navmisinfo_heading"><h1>How to navigate misinformation and disinformation</h1></div>
            <div class="navmisinfo_para">
                <p>It helps to think of misinformation and disinformation spreading in the same way as viruses. One person might share fake news with their friends and family, and then a handful of them share it with more of their friends and family, and before you know it, potentially harmful or dangerous information is taking over everyone’s newsfeed.</p>
                <p>ㅤ</p>
                <p>But just as we can protect against COVID-19 with hand washing, physical distancing and masks, we can slow down the spread of misinformation and disinformation by practising some information hygiene. Before sharing something, ask yourself these questions:</p>
                <li>How does this make me feel?</li>
                <li>Why am I sharing this?</li>
                <li>How do I know if it’s true?</li>
                <li>Where did it come from?</li>
                <li>Whose agenda might I be supporting by sharing it?</li>
                <p>ㅤ</p>
                <p>If you know something is false, or if it makes you angry, don’t share it to debunk it or make fun of it. That just spreads the misinformation or disinformation further.</p>
                <p>ㅤ</p>
                <p>Good places to go for reliable information are the websites of your national Ministry of Health or the World Health Organization. Remember, though: information will change as they learn more about the virus.</p>

                <p>ㅤ</p>
                <p>Inaccurate information spreads widely and at speed, making it more difficult for the public to identify verified facts and advice  from trusted sources, such as  their local health authority or WHO.</p>
