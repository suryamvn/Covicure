            <div class="physical_heading"><h2>Physical Activity</h2></div>
            <div class="physical_img"><img src="img/physical activity.png"></div>
            <div class="physical_para">
                <p>The COVID-19 pandemic means that many of us are staying at home  and sitting down more than we usually do. It’s hard for a lot of us to do the sort of exercise we normally do. It’s even harder for people who don’t usually do a lot of physical exercise.</p>
                <p>ㅤ</p>
                <p>But at a time like this, it’s very important for people of all ages and abilities to be as active as possible. WHO’s Be Active campaign aims to help you do just that - and to have some fun at the same time.</p>
                <p>ㅤ</p>
                <p>Remember - Just taking a short break from sitting, by doing 3-4 minutes of light intensity physical movement, such as walking or stretching, will help ease your muscles and improve blood circulation and muscle activity.</p>
                <p>ㅤ</p>
                <p>Regular physical activity benefits both the body and mind. It can reduce high blood pressure, help manage weight and reduce the risk of heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and various cancers - all conditions that can increase susceptibility to COVID-19.</p>
                <p>ㅤ</p>
                <p>It also improves bone and muscle strength and increases balance, flexibility and fitness. For older people, activities that improve balance help to prevent falls and injuries.</p>
                <p>ㅤ</p>
                <p>Regular physical activity can help give our days a routine and be a way to stay in contact with family and friends. It’s also good for our mental health - reducing the risk of depression, cognitive decline and delay the onset of dementia - and improve overall feelings.</p>
                <p>ㅤ</p>
                <h4>Infants under 1 year of age</h4>
                <li> All infants should be physically active several times a day.</li>
                <li>For those not yet mobile, this includes at least 30 minutes in prone position (tummy time), as floor-based play, spread throughout the day while awake.</li>
                <p>ㅤ</p>
                <h4>Children under 5 years of age</h4>
                <li> All young children should spend at least 180 minutes a day in a variety of types of physical activities at any intensity</li>
                <li> 3-4 year old children should spend at least 60 minutes of this time in moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity</li>
                <p>ㅤ</p>
                <h4>Children and adolescents aged 5-17 years</h4>
                <li> All children and adolescents should do at least 60 minutes a day of moderate to vigorous-intensity physical activity</li>
                <li> This should include activities that strengthen muscle and bone, at least 3 days per week</li>
                <li>Doing more than 60 minutes of physical activity daily will provide additional health benefits</li>
                <p>ㅤ</p>
                <h4>Adults aged over 18 years</h4>
                <li>All adults should do at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity throughout the week, or at least 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity physical activity throughout the week.</li>
                <li> For additional health benefits, adults should increase their moderate-intensity physical activity to 300 minutes per week, or equivalent.</li>
                <li>For developing and maintaining musculoskeletal health, muscle-strengthening activities involving major muscle groups should be done on 2 or more days a week</li>
                <li>In addition, older adults with poor mobility should do physical activity to enhance balance and prevent falls on 3 or more days per week.</li>

            <div class="diet_img"><img src="img/healthy diet.png"></div>
            <div class="diet_para">
                <p>Eating a healthy diet is very important during the COVID-19 pandemic. What we eat and drink can affect our body’s ability to prevent, fight and recover from infections.</p>
                <p>ㅤ</p>
                <p>While no foods or dietary supplements can prevent or cure COVID-19 infection, healthy diets are important for supporting immune systems. Good nutrition can also reduce the likelihood of developing other health problems, including obesity, heart disease, diabetes and some types of cancer.</p>
                <p>ㅤ</p>
                <p>For babies, a healthy diet means exclusive breastfeeding in the first six months, with the introduction of nutritious and safe foods to complement breastmilk from age 6 months to 2 years and beyond. For young children, a healthy and balanced diet is essential for growth and development. For older people, it can help to ensure healthier and more active lives.</p>
                <p>ㅤ</p>
                <h4>Tips for maintaining a healthy diet:</h4>
                <p>ㅤ</p>
                <li>Eat a variety of food, including fruits and vegetables</li>
                <li>Cut back on salt</li>
                <li>Eat moderate amounts of fats and oils</li>
                <li>Limit sugar intake</li>
                <li>Stay hydrated: Drink enough water</li>
                <li>Avoid hazardous and harmful alcohol use</li>
                <p>ㅤ</p>
                <h4>Tips for Food Safety during COVID-19</h4>
                <p>ㅤ</p>
                <p>There is no evidence that COVID-19 can be spread through contact with food or food packaging. COVID-19 is generally thought to be spread from person to person. However, it’s always important to practice good hygiene when handling food to prevent any food-borne illnesses. </p>
                <p>ㅤ</p>
                <p>Follow Five keys to safer food:</p>
                <li>Keep clean</li>
                <li>Separate raw and cooked</li>
                <li>Cook thoroughly</li>
                <li>Keep food at safe temperatures</li>
                <li>Use safe water and raw materials.</li>

            <div class="par_heading"><h2>Healthy Parenting</h2></div>
            <div class="par_img"><img src="img/healthy parenting.png"></div>
            <div class="par_para">
                <p>If your family is stuck at home during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, it’s likely your children are spending a lot more time online. School, chats with friends and grandparents, even music lessons — so much has shifted online.</p>
                <p>ㅤ</p>
                <p>Being connected helps children and teenagers reduce the impact of this new normal and encourages them to continue with their lives. But it also presents a new set of challenges for every parent. How can you maximize all that the internet has to offer, while minimizing the potential harm? It’s not an easy balance on a normal day, let alone when facing a health crisis like COVID-19.</p>
                <p>ㅤ</p>
                <h4>Keep them safe with open communication</h4>
                <p>ㅤ</p>
                <p>Have an honest dialogue with your children about who they communicate with and how. Make sure they understand the value of kind and supportive interactions and that mean, discriminatory or inappropriate contact is never acceptable. If your children experience any of these, encourage them to tell you or a trusted adult immediately. Be alert if your child appears to be upset or secretive with online activities or if they are experiencing cyberbullying.</p>
                <p>ㅤ</p>
                <p>Work with your child to establish rules on how, when and where devices can be used.</p>
                <p>ㅤ</p>
                <h4>Use technology to protect them</h4>
                <p>ㅤ</p>
                <p>Check that your child’s device is running the latest software and antivirus programs, and that privacy settings are on. Keep webcams covered when not in use. For younger children, tools such as parental controls, including safe search, can help keep online experiences positive.</p>
                <p>ㅤ</p>
                <p>Be cautious of free online educational resources. Your child should never have to provide a photo or their full name to use these resources. Remember to check the privacy settings to minimize data collection. Help your child learn to keep personal information private, especially from strangers.</p>
                <p>ㅤ</p>
                <h4>Spend time with them online</h4>
                <p>ㅤ</p>
                <p>Create opportunities for your child to have safe and positive online interactions with friends, family and you. Connecting with others is more important than ever at the moment and this can be an excellent opportunity for you to model kindness and empathy in your “virtual interactions”.</p>
                <p>ㅤ</p>
                <p>Help your child recognize and avoid misinformation and age-inappropriate content that may increase anxiety about the COVID-19 virus. Many digital resources from credible organizations like UNICEF and the World Health Organization are available for you and your child to learn about the virus together.</p>
                <p>ㅤ</p>
                <p>Spend time with your child to identify age appropriate apps, games and other online entertainment.</p>
                <p>ㅤ</p>
                <h4>Encourage healthy online habits</h4>
                <p>ㅤ</p>
                <p>Promote and monitor good behavior online and on video calls. Encourage your children to be kind and respectful to classmates, to be mindful of what clothes they wear and to avoid joining video calls from a bedroom. </p>
                <p>ㅤ</p>
                <p>Familiarize yourself with school policies and helplines to report cyberbullying or inappropriate online content.</p>
                <p>ㅤ</p>
                <p>As children spend more time online, they can be exposed to more advertising that may promote unhealthy foods, gender stereotypes or age-inappropriate material. Help them recognize online ads and use the opportunity to explore together what is wrong with some of the negative messaging you see.</p>
                <p>ㅤ</p>
                <h4>Let them have fun and express themselves</h4>
                <p>ㅤ</p>
                <p>Spending time at home can be a great opportunity for your children to use their voices online to share their views and support those in need during this crisis.</p>
                <p>ㅤ</p>
                <p>Encourage your child to take advantage of digital tools that get them up and moving, like online exercise videos for kids and video games that require physical movement.</p>
                <p>ㅤ</p>
                <p>Remember to balance online recreation with offline activities, including time outside, if possible.  </p>

                <h4>Why should you quit smoking and how can you do it?</h4>
                <p>ㅤ</p>
                <p>Smokers have a higher risk of getting coronavirus because they are constantly putting their hands to their lips.</p>
                <p>ㅤ</p>
                <p>And then, if they get coronavirus, they run a greater risk of getting a severe case because their lung function is impaired. </p>
                <p>ㅤ</p>
                <p>Quit today to reduce these risks and start living a healthier life.</p>
                <p>ㅤ</p>
                <h4>Quick tips to curb your cravings:</h4>
                <p>ㅤ</p>
                <li>Delay: Delay as long as you can before giving in to your urge.</li>
                <li>Deep breathing: Take 10 deep breaths to relax yourself from within until the urge passes. </li>
                <li>Drink water: Drinking water is a healthy alternative to sticking a cigarette in your mouth. </li>
                <li>Do something else to distract yourself: Take a shower, read, go for a walk, listen to music!</li>
                <p>ㅤ</p>

            <div class="mental_para">
                <h4>Looking after our mental health</h4>
                <p>ㅤ</p>
                <p>The new realities of working from home, temporary unemployment, home-schooling of children, and lack of physical contact with other family members, friends and colleagues take time to get used to. Adapting to lifestyle changes such as these, and managing the fear of contracting the virus and worry about people close to us who are particularly vulnerable, are challenging for all of us. They can be particularly difficult for people with mental health conditions.</p>
                <p>ㅤ</p>
                <p>Fortunately, there are lots of things that we can do to look after our own mental health and to help others who may need some extra support and care.Here are tips and advice that we hope you will find useful.</p>
                <p>ㅤ</p>
                <h4>Keep informed</h4>
                <p>ㅤ</p>
                <p>Listen to advice and recommendations from your national and local authorities. Follow trusted news channels, such as local and national TV and radio, and keep up-to-date with the latest news from @WHO on social media.</p>
                <p>ㅤ</p>
                <h4>Have a routine</h4>
                <p>ㅤ</p>
                <p>Keep up with daily routines as far as possible, or make new ones.</p>
                <li>Get up and go to bed at similar times every day.</li>
                <li>Keep up with personal hygiene.</li>
                <li>Eat healthy meals at regular times.</li>
                <li>Exercise regularly.</li>
                <li>Allocate time for working and time for resting.</li>
                <li>Make time for doing things you enjoy.</li>
                <p>ㅤ</p>
                <h4>Minimize newsfeeds</h4>
                <p>ㅤ</p>
                <p>Try to reduce how much you watch, read or listen to news that makes you feel anxious or distressed. Seek the latest information at specific times of the day, once or twice a day if needed.</p>
                <p>ㅤ</p>
                <h4>Social contact is important</h4>
                <p>ㅤ</p>
                <p>If your movements are restricted, keep in regular contact with people close to you by telephone and online channels.</p>
                <p>ㅤ</p>
                <h4>Alcohol and drug use</h4>
                <p>ㅤ</p>
                <p> Limit the amount of alcohol you drink or don’t drink alcohol at all. Don’t start drinking alcohol if you have not drunk alcohol before. Avoid using alcohol and drugs as a way of dealing with fear, anxiety, boredom and social isolation.</p>
                <p>ㅤ</p>
                <p>There is no evidence of any protective effect of drinking alcohol for viral or other infections. In fact, the opposite is true as the harmful use of alcohol is associated with increased risk of infections and worse treatment outcomes.</p>
                <p>ㅤ</p>
                <p>And be aware that alcohol and drug use may prevent you from taking sufficient precautions to protect yourself again infection, such as compliance with hand hygiene.</p>
                <p>ㅤ</p>
                <h4>Screen time</h4>
                <p>ㅤ</p>
                <p>Be aware of how much time you spend in front of a screen every day. Make sure that you take regular breaks from on-screen activities.</p>
                <p>ㅤ</p>
                <h4>Video games</h4>
                <p>ㅤ</p>
                <p>While video games can be a way to relax, it can be tempting to spend much more time on them than usual when at home for long periods. Be sure to keep the right balance with off-line activities in your daily routine.</p>
                <p>ㅤ</p>
                <h4>Social media</h4>
                <p>ㅤ</p>
                <p>Use your social media accounts to promote positive and hopeful stories. Correct misinformation wherever you see it.</p>
                <p>ㅤ</p>
                <h4>Help others</h4>
                <p>ㅤ</p>
                <p>If you are able to, offer support to people in your community who may need it, such as helping them with food shopping.</p>
                <p>ㅤ</p>
                <h4>Support health workers</h4>
                <p>ㅤ</p>
                <p>Take opportunities online or through your community to thank your country’s health-care workers and all those working to respond to COVID-19. </p>
                <p>ㅤ</p>
                <h4>Don’t discriminate</h4>
                <p>ㅤ</p>
                <p>Fear is a normal reaction in situations of uncertainty. But sometimes fear is expressed in ways which are hurtful to other people. Remember: </p>
                <p>ㅤ</p>
                <li>Be kind. Don’t discriminate against people because of your fears of the spread of COVID-19. </li>
                <li>Don’t discriminate against people who you think may have coronavirus.</li>
                <li>Don’t discriminate against health workers. Health workers deserve our respect and gratitude.</li>
                <li>COVID-19 has affected people from many countries. Don’t attribute it to any specific group.</li>
